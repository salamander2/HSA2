# Sample programs using HSA2

:one: Copy and run HSB_colours.java
   (HSB stands for the colour model Hue-Saturation-Brightness)

:two: Go into the folder "first_program" and read the PDF there. Follow the instructions and you should end up with a nice program called Fading.java

:three: Work through the 5 steps in the "Animation Tutorial" programs (animation folder). We're making a block breaking game.

:four: Have a look at the three sample programs that grade 11 students wrote. Try them out.
