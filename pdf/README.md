## Useful PDF files

These files provide some basic information about the HSA console.

It might appear that 1.1 and 1.2 are missing, 
but 1.1 is the syllabus for the UFA school which rewrote HSA and 1.2 is very simple Java basics.

*These files need updating to incorporate new changes made by J.Gray and M.Harwood.* (How does one edit a PDF?)

In spite of this, they are useful to get started with. 
Javadoc for the HSA2 files will be generated in a week or two and uploaded also.

The originals were made by me and can be found in .doc form at https://www.eotw1969.com/educators.html. Click on "Code and Other Resources" at the bottom of the page and then click the link for the "complete ICS3U course" to find the materials. I didn't put my name on the orignal .doc files, but I would appreciate it if anything shared here that's adapted from my materials gets attributed in part to me :-) Contact me at sam.scott@sheridancollege.ca
